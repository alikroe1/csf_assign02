//! Take the image below where each letter corresponds to a pixel

//! If both i and j are even, then the color and alpha value of the output
//! pixel are exactly the same as the input pixel at row i/2 and column j/2.

//! If i is even but j is odd, then the color components and alpha value
//! of the output pixel are computed as the average of those in the input pixels
//! in row i/2 at columns floor(j/2) and floor(j/2) + 1.
//! 
//! If i is odd and j is even, then the color components and alpha value
//! of the output pixel are computed as the average of those in the input pixels
//! in column j/2 at rows floor(i/2) and  floor(i/2) + 1.
//! 
//! If both i and j are odd then the color components and alpha value
//! of the output pixel are computed as the average of the input pixels
//! 
//! 1. At row floor(i/2) and column floor(j/2)
//! 2. At row floor(i/2) and column floor(j/2) + 1
//! 3. At row floor(i/2) + 1 and column floor(j/2)

//! Note that in the cases where either i or j is odd, it is not
//! necessarily the case that either row floor(i/2) + 1 or
//! column floor(j/2) + 1 are in bounds in the input image.
//! Only input pixels that are properly in bounds should be incorporated into
//! the averages used to determine the color components and alpha value
//! of the output pixel.

//! Averages should be computed using purely integer arithmetic with
